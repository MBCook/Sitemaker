Sitemaker Instructions

<p>The templates should all be pretty self explanitory. The program recurses through directories handling what it finds. The name of blog pages is taken from the sections.txt file in the parent directory, or if you are at the root directory of what sitemaker knows about, it's taken from line 16 of sitemaker.py.</p>
<p>templateEntry.txt is the template file for blog entries. tempateBody.txt is the template entriy for normal pages. template.txt is the main html template that everything is plugged into.</p>
<p>If you don't want to have any subdirectories of the current directory (say you want sitemaker to handle one and only one page) then just don't have a sections.txt file in that directory. The sections.txt file lists all subsections of the current section. Each is on a line that looks like "dirname - The tile of the subsection". You can have as many as you want (in theory, I never tested 200 but as long as you have the memory it should be fine). The style.txt file is needed in every directory. That tells whether it is a blog directory or a normal directory. It contains one line: "style - normal" or "style - blog".</p>
<p>I can't think of anything else important. Just put the sitemaker.py and sitemakerRoutines.py files at the root directory of where you want it to manage, go to that directory in the command line, and type "python sitemaker.py".</p>
