Section class:

	Type - Individual file? Directory? What?
	Name - The name of the section
	Path - The path for the section ("robots/", "cars.html", what?)
	Process - The function to process the section for us and make
			all the pages. This is where work is done

Section will be subclassed into the various kinds.

e.g. blogSection, fileSection, whatever.


For simplicity, each section MUST BE IN A DIRECTORY!!!!!!

Normal files are ONLY OK INSIDE FileSection!
